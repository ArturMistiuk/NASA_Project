# Solar Panel Farm Optimization Using NASA API Data

## Project Description:

In this project, I used the NASA API to gather data for specific coordinates to identify the optimal location for installing a solar panel farm. The data included solar insolation, cloud coverage, and sky clarity for various points. By analyzing these parameters, I was able to calculate and determine the most advantageous spot for maximizing the efficiency and productivity of a solar farm. This project supports renewable energy initiatives by leveraging precise environmental data to inform strategic decisions on solar farm placements.

## Visualizations

### Daily Insolation (AVG)
